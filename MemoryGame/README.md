# memoGame
Simple Memory Game that was written based on a tutorial with an upgrade :art:

### Tech used
It is based on VanillaJS as part of my learning proces.

### How does the game work?
- you need to find a pair of fruits.
- each attempt of trying to find a pair is counted as 1.
- if you won't succeed to find a pair two times in a row, the score will be counted as 2 - not 1.
- the lower your score is - the better.
